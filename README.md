# Zapier Platform

![CI Test Status](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/nodejs-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=gh-actions-ci)]

This is the main monorepo for all public code that powers the Zapier Platform Experience.

## Contents

It consists of a few main packages:

- `zapier-platform-cli`: The CLI that devs can use to perform common tasks with their apps (such as `push`, `promote`, etc)
- `zapier-platform-core`: The package which all apps depend on; it provides functionality at runtime.
- `zapier-platform-schema`: The source of truth for what's allowed in the structure a Zapier app; not typically installed directly
- `zapier-platform-legacy-scripting-runner`: If your app started as a Legacy Web Builder app, this provides a shim that keeps your app running seamlessly
- `example-apps/*`: A varied set of example apps to get you started
